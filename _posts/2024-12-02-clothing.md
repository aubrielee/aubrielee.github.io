# My needs and wants in clothing

{: .centeredText .noIndent}

<br>

I'm in search of clothes that are easy for my attendants to put on me and that I enjoy wearing.

## Articles I'm missing
* Summer gloves (long gloves)
* Winter gloves
* Summer cape with magnetic clasps
* Winter cape with magnetic clasps

## Articles I could use more of
* Skirts
* Dresses

## My size
* Clothes: 4
* Shoes: 8 W or 8.5 W

## Things I like

Functionally, these work well:
* Stretchy fabric
* Magnetic closures
* Quality zippers
* Midi or maxi length skirts

Aesthetically, I like:
* Gradients
* Tapers
* Gold
* Elegance

## Things that don't work for me

Functionally, these do not work well:
* Buttons (they are difficult to operate and get caught on my long hair)
* Belts

Aesthetically, I don't care for:
* Uniform patterns (e.g., plaid, polka dots)
* Blockiness (e.g., tiered skirts)
* Orange, muddy green
