_In my fourth year at Stanford, I took anatomy labs with Dr. John Gosling, Dr. Ian Whitmore, and Dr. Alan Detton. I then spent the summer writing this poem, which I consider one of my best works._


#Impart

<p class="secondIndent">The knowing limn for us these bodies of knowledge.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">As dissection disciples, we&rsquo;re knowing these bodies to learn, to treat, to numb;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">We have worn stereoscopic glasses, swiped the touch-screen table, made notes on inky paper,</p>
<p class="secondIndent">But never worn a scrub, or touched a lung, or made cuts in embalmed skin;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">By using death, we seek to know that which has been closest to us our whole lives.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">A teaching assistant tells us, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do the moment of reflection soon,&rdquo; <br class="poemBreak">as if he is used to it.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">The walkways are anastomosed between the chambers of the lab;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Each lobe is paved with a row of ceiling lights, and below them, a row of silver tables;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Between every port of forc&rsquo;ed light and every ventilated bench lies a blue canvas;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Inside, wrapped by zipper and linen, floats a body that has outlasted its last memory;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Whenever we zip the canvas closed, the body is lighter and the biohazard bag is heavier.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">A teaching assistant distributes his bouquet of scissors.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">Before lab, we don our blue identities; after lab, we wash them; and at the course&rsquo;s end, <br class="poemBreak">we give them back.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">When the professors find a curiosity to show us, or when students grow bored of <br class="poemBreak">quiet company,</p>
<p class="secondIndent">The ones in blue clothes move; the ones in white clothes stay.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Our objective is to commit all body parts to our own neurons.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Our objective is to gain immunity to instinctual humanity.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">I accidentally look at the thin cloth covering a face <br class="poemBreak">and see the body&rsquo;s nostrils and gaping mouth.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">We slowly replace the sallow skin with linen skin; the threads catch like hair in the zippers.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">To pierce the painless epidermis may be the most painful part, and to see it bleed with seeping, streaming yellow;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Unwrapping skin from the pledged present, we sweep the fascia cobwebs of the neck,</p>
<p class="secondIndent">We shave off pieces of the face and leave the shards on the chest;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Beneath the skin, the scalpel seems to part the flesh without touching it.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">A student leans against a cadaver&rsquo;s arm, resting his purple-gloved hand <br class="poemBreak">in its outstretched one.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">The symphony of oscillating saws shifts pitches as we press them into sparking tissue;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">We crown the hallowed calvaria with a rubber band and trace an artificial suture <br class="poemBreak">with a pencil;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Through synchrony of hammered taps and chiseled cracking, and the ripping of dura mater into jester fourths,</p>
<p class="secondIndent">The hollowed skull yields; in our hands, we halve a mind; sage, sagittal, oracular but open like a book; it drips dark red matter onto the floor.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">The dust of bone sinks like snow onto the crest of the auricle and rises like spicy smoke <br class="poemBreak">past our turbinates.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">A group of students whoops when the sternal plate finally comes off.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">The body is fabric: mesenteric ruffles, peritoneal cloth, layers of meninges sewn by <br class="poemBreak">sutures and spider string,</p>
<p class="secondIndent">While tendons never meant to touch the light still wear it well with their silk shimmer.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">A thick stitch on the right thigh identifies the site of cannulated preservative circulation.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">To whom belongs the hair that&rsquo;s wound in chair wheels and found stuck to <br class="poemBreak">organs we&rsquo;ve held?</p>
<p class="secondIndent">The body serves as a table for its own detached lungs and the tools we used to detach them; it wears its heart on its sarcophagal sleeve.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">A student asks about the pronunciation of &ldquo;azygos.&rdquo; &nbsp;The teaching assistant says, <br class="poemBreak">&ldquo;Tomater, tomahter.&rdquo; &nbsp;I say, &ldquo;You mean dura mater, dura mahter.&rdquo;</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">These bodies are not just our models, but our puppets; we pose their limbs <br class="poemBreak">and read their palms;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Their outstretched arms beg an embrace from the rolling lights that regard them <br class="poemBreak">without flinching.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">A cadaver on its stomach reaches into a professor&rsquo;s pocket as he dissects its shoulder.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">To show the flexion of the phalanges, a professor pulls the tendons, <br class="poemBreak">and we see death beckon.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">To delineate the facial nerves, a professor strokes the exposed, frozen cheek <br class="poemBreak">as if it were a lover&rsquo;s.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">I see drips of liquid on the kitchen floor at home, and for a moment, I mistake it for <br class="poemBreak">blood from a brain.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">Our often tendency, to ask for valued ganglions, visuals at hand;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">We cross our cruciate ligament fingers psoas to remember necrotic mnemonics;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">A thing between two things; by motor car, cold beer in forty-three cans, some say to steal a real trucker&rsquo;s only apple;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Ill, ilium, ileum, pleural, pericardial, periosteal, perineal, peroneal, peritoneal, peril;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">We remember exceptions; the exceptional are memorable.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">A teaching assistant holds a prosection of a female hip on her lap.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">At the head of the table are two heads, a young one hunched over the dead one he dissects;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">He looks it in the eye; their faces are antiparallel, with up and down inverted like <br class="poemBreak">extraocular obliques;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">As pupils, we see two tenuous circles: the tendinous ring guides fibrous nerves, and the iris passes light through fluid glass.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Behind the throat, the flower-calyxed larynx is cut cruciform; medical students don&rsquo;t learn the muscles for the patient&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">On the digital anatomy table, extruded cylinders pierce the patients&rsquo; faces where their eyes should be.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">I stuff my jacket into my bag and notice that the open sleeves look like severed arteries.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">The pituitary is the keystone of the cranium, the pearl in the ossified shell,</p>
<p class="secondIndent">The center of the X made by petrous bone and lesser wing, at the center of the X mapped by the chiasm of sight,</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Ensconced in a Turkish throne and wearing the Willis circlet, surrounded by the sap of thought and life,</p>
<p class="secondIndent">A monarch at the heart of two sphenoid and ventricular butterflies that interlock like links of a chain,</p>
<p class="secondIndent">It surveys its domain from the vertex of the cliff before the cascading tiers of <br class="poemBreak">the cranial fossa.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">I study a piecewise face. &nbsp;Its right half is stripped, its left half is intact, and its top half is peeled down over its eyes.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">The cadaver must not dry out; as water was the cells&rsquo; essence in life, so is it their <br class="poemBreak">vessel in death.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">The body seems to be melting into its water; the limbs are still, but they dance sinusoidally in their rippling reflection;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">Twin seashells curl in an ethmoid labyrinth; the splenic artery leviathan hides beneath the chest of treasures;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">A nautilus notes a chord; semicircular canals chart the waters along Cartesian planes;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">The woven rope of chordae tendineae anchor the cuspid sails as blood flows tidally <br class="poemBreak">through them.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">I see a fresh head. &nbsp;The neck is getting blood all over the rags. &nbsp;The fat on the inside of the neck doesn&rsquo;t cling, it spills; and the fat is not white, but saturated orange. &nbsp;The skin is compliant and still blushes around the sunken, drifting eyes. &nbsp;Nothing we&rsquo;ve seen so far has looked as real or as dead as this partial man.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">We take apart these bodies because they are made in the image of time and the world.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">In origin, round ligaments and an oval fossil draw the one-way cycle of a fetus&rsquo;s growth;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">To question parsimony and design, the tendons in the ankle trace the tangled path of systemless evolution;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">The tree of life grows in the cerebellum&rsquo;s arbor vitae, in muscles&rsquo; wood grain and red soleus sun, in the ridges of the crista terminalis illuminated from behind;</p>
<p class="secondIndent">We study existence: we see the history of the body, we see the world, and we see <br class="poemBreak">the history of the world.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">I feel someone walk behind me and see her out of the corner of my eye. &nbsp;When I turn to look, she has already gone. &nbsp;In her place is a skeleton hanging in a frame.</p>
<br>
<p class="secondIndent">We think we are the knowing now; from bodies of knowledge, we&rsquo;ve extracted knowledge <br class="poemBreak">of bodies.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">I understand a little more the intricate differentiations of being, although I have yet to witness a scalpel disinter a soul.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">The students move on to seek more answers, the professors stay to answer more students, and the fragmented cadavers burn.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">By sacrificing an instrument they will never play again, the donors make themselves immortal; they become part of a deathless practice.</p>
<p class="secondIndent">These undertakings of physical introspection are older than we are, and they will live longer than will any one of us.</p>
