# A ramp, a tent, and a weekend well spent

I’ve never been mistaken for someone who likes camping. But when Elliot told me about his pre-wedding retreat in the woods, I couldn’t say no.

When I signed up for these three nights, Peter convinced me to choose Tent rather than Cabin. He’s gone camping many times before, he said. It’ll be fine, he said.

As we prepare for the trip, my dad reminds me that I should have a will.

We set out in Elliot’s family van, which can fit my manual wheelchair. A mosquito attacks me before we even get there. Then, within ten minutes of arriving, I get a bite on my forehead. It swells. Anyone spending money on cosmetic fillers, just apply mosquito.

Later, Elliot gives me a mosquito-repellent bracelet. It seems to work well, except for the time I tambourine it at a mosquito, and the mosquito lands on it.

I’m worried about ticks. I tell Peter to bring duct tape. He does. I tell him he can tape his pants to his socks like the websites say. He refuses. When we arrive, the owner is walking around barefoot.

He says they haven’t had any ticks on campers in the past month. Translation: Campers were getting ambushed by ticks as recently as a month ago.

When I ask about accessibility, the owner shows me a shower stall with no bench inside. I’m not surprised, since I expect the worst. But on the third day, Peter notices that a different stall does have a shower bench. The bathroom that’s older—or, “more rustic”, in the owner’s words—is actually the more accessible one. The other one they renovated with sinks I can’t roll under.

Peter and I are prepared to subsist on protein bars and two boxes of vegan macaroni and cheese. But we’re delighted to find a wealth of options on shelves of plenty. At dinner, Peter, who has low vision, appreciates how people describe items and whether they’re vegan. I appreciate that everyone lets me have my food first, because my limited mouth muscles mean snails eat faster than I do.

At night, Peter wheels me past the cozy glow of the cabins with their clean beds and space heaters, and we arrive at our piece of meadow. Peter reminds me we’re saving money. I say we might as well be paying extra for the privilege of sleeping on the ground.

I can hear the wind through the trees. It sounds just like the white noise machine in the bathroom.

One meaning of the name Aubrie is “ruler of the elves”. I’ve always had an affinity for fantasy forests (fantasy meaning without dirt). One morning, as I lie in the tent, I look up at the soft sunlight and pretend the floaters in my vision are fairies. One of them looks like a shrimp.

I had COVID two weeks ago, but after two negative tests, I had no luck using it as an excuse not to go. My cough had gotten better, but on the second day of camping, it gets much worse. Coughing is difficult to accomplish when one doesn’t have muscles, which is why I’m high-risk for respiratory complications. I hope my fellow tenters aren’t too bothered by my nighttime wildlife sounds.

I’m grateful that Elliot, Layla, and others keep checking up on how Peter and I are doing. I feel reassured when Elliot says we can figure something out if we need to get me off-site early. But I decide I’m in for the full core memory:

* getting to know Elliot’s and Layla’s kind and often over-educated friends;
* being patiently understood through my speech impairment;
* laughing over games and Lorenzo’s hilarious sense of humor;
* crying at Adrian’s toast;
* laughing at others’ roasts;
* relishing lavish dishes that impress me every time;
* gathering at toothbrush parties;
* admiring the genius of whoever rested the toothpaste in the counter’s mystery nozzle;
* witnessing Peter and Daniel discover they both read the Caltrain High Speed Rail Compatibility Blog;
* seeing drum-circlers’ joy as they fall into a rising pulse;
* replenishing my energy with a fruit bowl D. J. caringly prepared for me;
* aww-ing at the right and wrong times during Elliot’s vows;
* watching sunlight stream and sunset bleed through the trees;
* feeling happy—even in a tent—because I’m with my sweet dreamy love;
* looking up through the tent window at clouds flowing by;
* receiving hello smiles and goodbye hugs.

On the way home, my airway gradually improves. By the next day, it’s significantly better. I say the coughing was from breathing in all the mosquitoes. Peter says it could have been from the wood-burning stove. I say it was because I’m allergic to camping. Peter says it was probably the wood-burning stove.

“Look at all those mosquito bites!” my dad remarks, pointing to my pimples.

When I can finally get showered again, I can’t remember whether we rinse my shampoo out or do soap first. That’s how long it’s been—I’ve forgotten how to shower.

People ask me how I liked camping in a tent. I call it a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

But really, to have a chance to sleep among constellations of flowers, to be so loved and cared for that I didn’t have to be afraid, and to be part of a community of people celebrating two souls in the universe finding each other, is an adventure I’ll treasure for the rest of my life.
