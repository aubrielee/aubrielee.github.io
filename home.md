A bit of my journey:
{: .noIndent }

I’m a professional namer at Google, where I’ve had the honor of being part of several marketing teams since 2013 and attending an executive training at Wharton (here are my notes).

I earned an engineering degree from Stanford University’s Mechanical Engineering department. I also completed the premed curriculum because, before Google recruited me, I planned to follow my parents’ path and become a doctor. I graduated with honors and was invited to join Tau Beta Pi (in my third year, a year ahead of most invitees) and Phi Beta Kappa.

I have always loved creating art, whether with painted lines or written ones. In my first year at Stanford, poet Eavan Boland selected my entry for 1st place in Stanford’s Urmy–Hardy Prize in Poetry, and after I graduated, I spent the summer coalescing all my observations from cadaver anatomy labs into a poem published in Stanford School of Medicine’s literary journal. I studied oil painting as a child, explored graphic design in college, and am now learning 3D modeling and animation with Blender.
