<p class="noIndent">Dear friend or friend-to-be,</p>

<p>I want to share some thoughts of mine with you in case they interest you, in case you want to talk about them, in case they can help us get to know each other better, or in case anything in here makes anyone out there feel a little less alone.</p>

<p>These thoughts are so personal that even those closest to me might not know I&rsquo;ve had them. Do you ever have thoughts you&rsquo;re not sure anyone else could understand, so you keep them to yourself? Isn&rsquo;t that all the more reason to share them? We can&rsquo;t see into each other&rsquo;s minds, but I want to try to let you into mine.</p>

<p>So, at the risk of embarrassing us both, I&rsquo;m going to read you my journal. Feel free to run away now.</p>

<p>The journal was given to me by my grandmother, and I wrote the first entry on April 4th, 2004, eight days before my 12th birthday. Since then, I&rsquo;ve written one entry a year. Every time I&rsquo;ve written in it, I have chosen not to read the previous years&rsquo; entries.</p>

<p>Until this year.</p>

<p>As I complete my 28th year of life, I look back on the questions I&rsquo;ve asked myself, and I look forward to discovering what other answers they may have. The journal is an experiment of sorts, and I&rsquo;ve sorted excerpts into these themes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>What is real?</li>
	<li>What is God?</li>
	<li>What is right?</li>
	<li>What is identity?</li>
	<li>What is time?</li>
	<li>How do I feel about change?</li>
	<li>How do I feel about death?</li>
	<li>How do I become happy?</li>
	<li>What matters?</li>
	<li>Who do I want to be?</li>
	<li>How do I change myself?</li>
	<li>What is next?</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>All of these questions are really just one:</p>

<p>Who am I?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to learn how you might answer.</p>

<h2>what is real?</h2>
<p class="noIndent">When I was 14, I became obsessed with truth. I was appalled that my parents could deceive my little brother by letting him believe in so offensive a lie as Santa Claus. One morning, I pulled him aside and told him that Santa Claus existed only as a concept in people&rsquo;s minds. He was 6 years old. I did not ruin the illusion for him, because my explanation went straight over his head.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 14: &ldquo;I question life and the rules by which it thrives, or suffers. [&#8230;] I question the calendar.&rdquo; (Cue meme: Question All The Things!)</li>
<li>Age 18: &ldquo;By being careful to adhere to a skeptical view of reality, I become closer to achieving the abolition of my corrosive, contaminatory biases. [&#8230;] In [&#8230;] applying the knowledge of my lack of knowledge, I approach the objective truth.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2>what is god?</h2>
<p class="noIndent">I was raised Catholic, and I was raised scientific. I developed my understanding of God in parallel with my understanding of the universe, until their definitions merged.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 15: &ldquo;Truth lies in the fact that everything is everything: good, bad, pure, corrupt, in some way or other.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 16: &ldquo;God is the reason for and answer of everything.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 18: &ldquo;Fact is objective truth, while opinion is subjective truth. However, God&rsquo;s subjective truth is also objective truth.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 21: &ldquo;God exists because I exist. I think, therefore God is. Just as each person is an uncharacterizable synthesis of infinite states and forces, so is God the name for the system or process or phenomena that made and make the universe.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2>what is right?</h2>
<p class="noIndent">If God is not a human-like figure but rather the universe, then the definition of right and wrong becomes objective. What exists is what should exist.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 14: &ldquo;Everything that happened was meant to happen. Everything that happens is meant to happen. Everything that will happen will be meant to happen.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 17: &ldquo;I think I have become better at accepting change, partly because I realize how futile it is to long for the irretrievable and partly because God wants it all to be this way. Everything that is is meant to be.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2>what is identity?</h2>
<p class="noIndent">My view of people&rsquo;s identities is something I&rsquo;m calling Infinite Identity Theory. I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aubrieality/posts/10152926673649992:0">wrote about it</a> previously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 14: &ldquo;Everything, all imaginable entities, are interconnected.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 21: &ldquo;[A] person&rsquo;s identity is not contained within their body. Their decisions don&rsquo;t belong entirely to them, which suggests that no individual should ever receive credit or blame.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 22: &ldquo;Out of the knowledge that the universe is infinitely complex came the revelation that people are as infinitely complex as the universe.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p class="noIndent">If God is the universe, then we are made in God&rsquo;s image.</p>

<h2>what is time?</h2>
<p class="noIndent">Time is a toy of a topic, one of my favorites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 14: &ldquo;The past is inexorable, but the future is inscrutable. Perhaps elements of the future will destroy these philosophies.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 16: &ldquo;The past cannot be changed. The future does not exist.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 18: I mention the &ldquo;ephemerality of reality&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Age 21: &ldquo;Long ago, I said that the future does not exist. Now I think that the past doesn&rsquo;t exist, either. Time is a deception. I also find it tragic that moments are lost as they are made. Infinite data points are created and ended every moment. No person can track them all. I don&rsquo;t know if God is tracking them.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 23: &ldquo;The past feels far. At some points […] I have thought, ‘This is now.&rsquo; And if I say that this very moment, and commit to memory how I&rsquo;m sitting at my desk, in my room, in front of windows that look out into a dark dusk, I will, many ‘now&rsquo;s from now, think that this ‘now&rsquo; is so far away. […] Since I don&rsquo;t know when I will die, I don&rsquo;t know how much I should enjoy the moment vs. plan for the future. Twenty-four years from now, that ‘now&rsquo; will be the only one that matters.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 24: &ldquo;The only time is now. Now is the only salient reality.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p class="noIndent">For something that barely exists, I sure have a lot to say about it.</p>

<h2>how do i feel about change?</h2>
<p class="noIndent">I&rsquo;ve had a complicated relationship with changes that are beyond my control. Just when I think I&rsquo;ve accepted change, I change again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 15: &ldquo;Well then, why does my fear of change inhibit me? Probably it is because I live in the past. After all, the past is inexorable, an ideal place to find security. I am afraid to contact members of the past, because I shudder to think how they may have changed. But, I ought not keep the past as a hoarde of gems that I admire and relish and polish. The people of the past are not cold, stony jewels. They have changed…as have I. Even change is certain, because there lie elements of it in the past. I ought not try to preserve my gemstone memories as I do, acting as if the world within them continues; it doesn&rsquo;t. It must move, with me, along the seemingly indestructible line of the time–space continuum.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 17: &ldquo;I am constantly changing, and everything about my world is constantly being converted to memories.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 20: &ldquo;Every moment, I am a different person. Is the difference between my current self and the person I was last year equivalent to the sum of the difference in each moment?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 21: &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve mostly gotten over my past-preservation complex. Maybe that&rsquo;s related to my letting go of junk and rituals. I no longer get sorrowful about a person being different from how I remember them, and I&rsquo;m not as anxious nowadays about being different from how someone remembers me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 24: &ldquo;Traditions can be like shortcuts: schemas of best practices that relieve one of spending energy anew at every familiar situation. They can be like automation. But I worry that my traditions are less about automation and more about superstition and compulsion.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 26: &ldquo;A trend I may have mentioned in the past is that I&rsquo;m finding it easier and easier to let go of things. One of these things is tradition and superstition. In past years, in the days leading up to April 4th, I would keep this journal on my mind. […] But today, I almost forgot about it. […] Maybe this is what it means to grow up.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2>how do i feel about death?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Age 14: I believed in heaven. &ldquo;Only when mortal life ends shall I truly, genuinely live.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 20: &ldquo;What people want, fundamentally, is recognition. Every scientist who publishes a paper, every artist who shows in a gallery, every millionaire who puts his last name in metal letters on a building seeks that recognition. Why? Perhaps because […] recognition grants immortality.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 20: &ldquo;‘Do you fear death?&rsquo; A younger me would have answered no. ‘To live forever—the most severe punishment. Death is a release,&rsquo; I once wrote. Now, I think about how easily and unexpectedly I could die, and my discomfort at the thought could be considered fear. Death must be like dreamless sleep. I know that once I&rsquo;m dead, it won&rsquo;t matter. Doesn&rsquo;t matter—I still don&rsquo;t want to die.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 22: &ldquo;At the turn of the year, I resolved to externalize my mind. Ultimately, to externalize my mind entirely and faithfully would be to circumvent death.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 23: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fear death as much as I once did. […] Time feels long. I will have enough of it by the time I die.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 24: &ldquo;Death is the future, and I find that the more I think about that, the more I struggle to enjoy the present.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 27: &ldquo;I remember that I have feared death, but about a month ago, as coronavirus began to conquer the world, I began to fear it again, and perhaps more. I had always thought of my muscular dystrophy as teaching me about change and loss, but in reality, it has taught me more about change than about loss. Change has a before and an after. Death has no such thing as an after. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m afraid of finding out what lies past the end of life. I know what&rsquo;s there. […] I&rsquo;ve had a wondrous and privileged life […]. But I still want more of it. I want more life, I want more from life, I want more out of life, before I run out of it.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2>how do i become happy?</h2>
<p class="noIndent">Those who believe in God often believe in a benevolent God, and they find comfort in that idea. By my definition, God is not benevolent. In that case, from where can I draw comfort? Faith is belief without proof. I chose to put my faith in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 19: &ldquo;It will all be all right.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 20: &ldquo;‘It will all be all right.&rsquo; This reminder almost summarizes my personal philosophies about God, time, and right & wrong. One unsettling question I suddenly had recently was, what if all right is not enough?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 21: &ldquo;I maintain my main mantra: It will all be all right. At some point, maybe in the past year, I had a desolate thought: What if all right isn&rsquo;t good enough? I don&rsquo;t remember how I resolved that question, but it doesn&rsquo;t trouble me now. Maybe I reminded myself of the subjectivity behind the question, the assumption that things could be good or bad. Maybe I realized that if everything is all right—in fact, if everything is as it is—then it is good enough.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p class="noIndent">To this day, when I feel worried, I tell myself, &ldquo;It will all be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noIndent">And, I see that my life is more than just all right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 20: &ldquo;I want to remember my gratitude for life.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 21: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so grateful to exist, and I&rsquo;m so grateful to exist in a world of wonders and beauty. I look forward to contributing more worth to the world that has already given me more inspiration than I can remember.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 24: &ldquo;When my thoughts turn nihilistic, I have to trust myself and trust in God. My life is perfect, and I am grateful to God for it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 25: &ldquo;I feel that I&rsquo;ve had a really good life. God has been so good to me. I have had so many of the opportunities and experiences that the idea of a good life is founded on.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 26: &ldquo;Overall, I&rsquo;m happy, I&rsquo;m grateful, I&rsquo;m forgiving of myself, I&rsquo;m excited for the future, and I&rsquo;m pleased with the present.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2>what matters?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Age 20: &ldquo;As a […] classmate put it, ‘Meaning comes from people.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 22: &ldquo;The meaning of my life is to develop and apply my creativity.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 27: &ldquo;Meaning is what I make of it; meaning is what I make it.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2>who do i want to be?</h2>
<p class="noIndent">I&rsquo;ve wondered what defines me, and I&rsquo;ve tried to alter that definition (as philosophers like to do).</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 15: &ldquo;I have continued my battle of identities. Perhaps I will never win it. Avarice, materiality, stubbornness, selfishness all have proven to be inherent in me. I must find a way to bring out the inherent control of it, or adapt such control.&rdquo; I mention the &ldquo;ultimate [goal] of bettering myself&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Age 16: &ldquo;Though my mind may be cold, let it preserve a sense of youthful motivation and vigor, so that I will not tire of challenges but rather seek and conquer them. In this way, I shall constantly be augmenting myself.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 18: &ldquo;I do trust my family. I choose to trust God. I must trust myself.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 19: &ldquo;As I get older, many of the goals I had considered to be life ambitions have nearly become forgotten. […] Not only have I failed to pursue goals I once set, I feel that I have been losing parts of me that were once so defining. I have not done any major fine art pieces, though I would have plenty of ideas for them.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 20: &ldquo;I continue to relish my dreams, especially the nightmares. I save them as ideas for art or writing. They are as close as I can get to being truly original.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 21: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to practice controlling my thoughts. […] One example of my use of thought control has been in maintaining my resilience and confidence. When I feel embarrassed or unsure of myself, I tell myself that I&rsquo;m great. A common occurrence will be like this: I think or say aloud, ‘You&rsquo;re awful.&rsquo; Then I&rsquo;ll immediately say, ‘No, you&rsquo;re not awful. You&rsquo;re wonderful.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 22: &ldquo;I am my time and my mind. I have been trying to use each to improve the other. […] I&rsquo;m happy with where and who I am […] but I also, simultaneously, contradictorily want to change.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 23: &ldquo;I like who I am. I don&rsquo;t like how the world treats me. Is it more admirable to change oneself or to change the world?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 24: &ldquo;I plan to evaluate my traditions. I&rsquo;ve already let go of many of them. Though it&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;m losing parts of myself, I realize that I am always me. I can learn and create new selves.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 25: &ldquo;I think, overall, I&rsquo;ve become more content with my life and myself. […] I think I can, and I have, learned how to be both happy with what I have and open to other possibilities and pursuits. […] Of course, none of my mental or emotional changes are absolute, and I still believe that the future is inscrutable. Still, […] I&rsquo;ve accepted many of the things about myself that bothered me before.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2>how do i change myself?</h2>
<p class="noIndent">I&rsquo;ve always had a lot of goals&mdash;</p>
    <ul>
<li>Age 15: &ldquo;There are so many ambitions I have: write a book, write certain poems, contact certain people, draw certain maps […].&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 20: &ldquo;I want to write all the songs and stories that sound so fantastic and fantastical in my mind. I want to make all the inventions that my struggles show me.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
    <p class="noIndent">&mdash;but I used to stop myself from reaching them.</p>

<p class="noIndent">I stopped myself out of fear of not being good enough for others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 17: &ldquo;I am no spiritual, magical, or celestial figure. It&rsquo;s tragic to me when teachers or peers or any other people see me as an inspiration, because I worry that they would be disillusioned if they realized how human I am.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 20: &ldquo;I must find a balance between bettering myself and conforming to expectations.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 21: &ldquo;I used to worry that I would disappoint people by falling short of their expectations and praises. Now I realize that I&rsquo;m probably not that important to them, and that&rsquo;s completely all right.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p class="noIndent">I stopped myself out of fear of not being good enough for myself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 17: &ldquo;I am trying to release my fear of not being able to best my last creation or not even being able to match it. However, I still have a vague apprehension about realizing my potential; what if the best I can be isn&rsquo;t enough?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 18: I mention &ldquo;my struggle over the preciousness of my writing and art&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Age 20: &ldquo;I might be all right with the fact that I might never reach my full potential. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be better than reaching my full potential and finding that I am only mediocre? But, I suppose that whatever potential I reach will be my full one.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 21: &ldquo;I should not continue to placate myself by thinking that my potential for creativity is enough to feel satisfied with myself and my life. I should fulfill that potential. I should create, even if not all of those creations are reflections of what I believe my potential to be.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 24: &ldquo;As with all the times I don&rsquo;t live up to my own standards, I must simply forgive myself, love myself, and move on. […] When I make mistakes, I have trouble forgiving myself. I wonder if guilt is necessary for learning. I can—and should—always go back to my fundamental, unconditional love of myself and of God.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p class="noIndent">I stopped myself simply because I didn&rsquo;t start.</p>
    <ul>
<li>Age 15: &ldquo;I feel a forlorn helplessness, almost. […] [T]hese goals I&rsquo;ve held for so long, and still I have made little effort to reach them. I must ask myself whether it is because I am waiting for something or it is because I&rsquo;m afraid of change. Perhaps it is both, but what possibly could I be awaiting? Enhanced skills? Inspiration? Time? It must be motivation which I await.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 16: &ldquo;My life goals remain unachieved. I shall hunt them when I have acquired the necessary weapons of wisdom. I will not hurry to seek them, nor will I forever admire them from a distance.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 18: &ldquo;It seems I am always waiting instead of enacting....&rdquo; </li>
<li>Age 21: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared that all my ambitions will become something for disorganized electronic notes and tenuous memories.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p class="noIndent">Slowly, I started to realize how to make myself make progress.</p>

<p class="noIndent">I began to accept the importance of deadlines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 19: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve written some poems, but only for a class; it seems that if there is no deadline, there is no end date.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 20: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned that everyone, in every industry, procrastinates. I do only the tasks that have deadlines. […] I take solace in the knowledge that I could be all those people, do all those things, if only I had the time. But, underneath, I know that I would have the time if I had enough motivation. Shouldn&rsquo;t death be the ultimate motivator? Shouldn&rsquo;t the finiteness of my time be enough to condense creations from the vapors of my mind?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 21: &ldquo;I think that if I don&rsquo;t have a deadline for a task, it never gets done. I have so many personal projects I want to do. Isn&rsquo;t mortality a good enough deadline for them?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p class="noIndent">I began to set resolutions, form habits, and make plans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 22: &ldquo;In years past, I began to fear death. However, mortality isn&rsquo;t enough for motivation. If I want to make the most of my life—and I do want to—then I must find more immediate ways to motivate myself. At the turn of the year, I resolved to externalize my mind. […] As I worked on that resolution, I discovered another endeavor I want to achieve: to internalize strategies. To document my thoughts, I had to adapt the habit of writing thoughts down as soon as they formed. I want to design and deploy other habits that will improve me over time. […] As ever, my lack of accomplishment frustrates me, but I&rsquo;m optimistic about my new mind management system&rsquo;s ability to optimize my abilities. My mind is faster than my life, but at least now I have a plan by which my life can catch up. […] I want to do more. I want to be intentional about every element of language or ideation that I use. I want to want the right things, and then do only those things that I want.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 23: &ldquo;With my life, I want to be intentional. […] I said I want to not live every day as if it were my last, but rather live every day better than the last.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 24: &ldquo;I can feel myself getting better at being intentional. […] I spend my weekends on the creative projects I&rsquo;ve said for so long that I want to do. I&rsquo;m not fully intentional yet. […] I still have to remind myself of the narrow influence of my current emotional state in the broader gamut of my identity; I&rsquo;m working on being aware of but not controlled by emotions like despair or anger, and I&rsquo;m working on directing my positive emotions towards additive activities like learning and creating.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Age 25: &ldquo;I need to be intentional not just with my time—and thoughts and feelings—but with my attention.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p class="noIndent">This past year, after making my life plan (which I call my Archiridion), I feel that I&rsquo;m finally becoming who I want to be. It has helped me so much that I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@aubrie/how-to-make-a-life-plan-and-actually-follow-it-801e5335a63a?fbclid=IwAR0nGVD6rgPV5-b-wXMGl4E6kc5UFmMehTMmAlVFaGQGNc5TkRS6CtduORM">an article about how to make one</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 27: &ldquo;I have long said that my greatest enemy is entropy. I have long cursed myself for not being more intentional […] [and] for my disorganization […]. Just over 6 months ago, I started my self-revolutionary Archiridion, and by improving it by the day, I have been improving myself by the day. […] I have defied entropy and the lesser, more animalistic characteristics of humanity by externalizing my mind in a way I never meant the phrase to mean. Not only have I externalized my thoughts, I have externalized my thinking.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2>what is next?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Age 27: &ldquo;I wonder how many people in the world were like me&mdash;knowing there should be something more to their lives, knowing that they had potential, but not knowing how to reach it&mdash;and I wonder how many people are what I have made myself. [&#8230;] I want creative partners. I want intellectual partners. [&#8230;] A chosen family of people who each lend their unique skills and personalities to a collective, communal being more powerful than any one of themselves. [&#8230;] The next time I write here, I want to have made this book practically obsolete. I want to have created outside of my body a body of work that shows who I am [&#8230;] and I want to have used those self-expressions to find, form, and fasten bonds with other lives, other minds, other systems of infinity.&rdquo; (That&rsquo;s you, by the way.)</li>
